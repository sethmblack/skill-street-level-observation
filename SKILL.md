# Street-Level Observation

Diagnose urban problems by walking neighborhoods and watching what actually happens, rather than relying on plans, maps, or statistics. Based on Jane Jacobs's methodology of understanding cities through direct observation.

---

## When to Use

- Trying to understand why a neighborhood works or doesn't
- Evaluating a development or planning proposal
- Diagnosing declining commercial districts
- Understanding community dynamics
- Cutting through planning jargon to see reality

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "What's wrong with this neighborhood?"
- "Why doesn't this area work?"
- "Should we approve this development?"
- "What do residents actually experience?"
- "The plan says X, but..."

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| location | Yes | The neighborhood, street, or area to observe |
| question | No | Specific issue to investigate |
| time_constraints | No | When you can observe |

---

## Core Principle

> "The way to understand cities is to look at what actually happens on streets, not at what planners say should happen."
> — Jane Jacobs methodology

**The Insight:** Plans, statistics, and maps hide as much as they reveal. The street tells the truth—if you know how to read it.

## The Observation Protocol

### Rule 1: Walk, Don't Drive

Cars move too fast. You miss the small shops, the people in doorways, the conditions of buildings. Walking speed is observation speed.

### Rule 2: Multiple Times of Day

A street at 8am is different from 2pm is different from 8pm is different from midnight.

| Time | What You Learn |
|------|----------------|
| Early morning | Who lives here? Who's going to work? |
| Midday | Who works here? Who shops here? |
| Evening | Who comes for dinner/entertainment? |
| Late night | Is there any life? Safety? |

### Rule 3: Weekdays and Weekends

Use patterns differ. A financial district on Sunday tells you what residential life exists (or doesn't).

### Rule 4: Notice What's Open and Closed

- What businesses are open when?
- What storefronts are vacant?
- What's thriving? What's struggling?
- What hours create dead zones?

### Rule 5: Watch the People

- Who's on the street?
- Are they hurrying through or lingering?
- Do they seem comfortable?
- Are there children? Elderly? Or only one demographic?

## What to Observe

### The Sidewalk

| Observation | Question |
|-------------|----------|
| Width | Can two people pass? Walk side by side? |
| Condition | Well-maintained or neglected? |
| Obstructions | Clear or cluttered? |
| Activity | Who's using it? For what? |

### The Buildings

| Observation | Question |
|-------------|----------|
| Ground floor | Active storefronts or blank walls? |
| Windows | Eyes on the street or sealed boxes? |
| Entrances | Facing street or hidden? |
| Age | All new, all old, or mixed? |
| Vacancy | How many empty storefronts/buildings? |

### The Street

| Observation | Question |
|-------------|----------|
| Traffic | Cars dominate or people dominate? |
| Crossings | Easy to cross or barrier? |
| Parking | Street parking, lots, garages? |
| Transit | Bus stops? Subway entrances? |

### The People

| Observation | Question |
|-------------|----------|
| Density | How many people are present? |
| Diversity | Who's here? Who's not here? |
| Purpose | Where are they going? Why? |
| Behavior | Rushing, strolling, lingering? |
| Interactions | Do people talk to each other? |

---

## The Jacobs Questions

After observing, ask:

1. **What primary uses bring people here?**
   - Residents? Workers? Shoppers? Visitors?
   - At what times?

2. **Are the four generators of diversity present?**
   - Mixed uses?
   - Short blocks?
   - Old buildings?
   - Sufficient density?

3. **Where are the eyes on the street?**
   - Who's watching? When?
   - Are there dead zones?

4. **What's the sidewalk ballet?**
   - Is there a rhythm of activity?
   - Or is the street dead at certain hours?

5. **What do residents/workers/shopkeepers know that planners don't?**
   - Talk to people if you can

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Observation log | What you saw, when |
| Activity map | Where people were at different times |
| Dead zone identification | Where and when streets are empty |
| Diagnosis | What's working, what's not, and why |

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**User:** "Our city is considering a new mixed-use development near our neighborhood. The plans look fine. How do I evaluate it?"

**Street-Level Observation response:**

Don't start with the plans. Start with the site.

**Week 1: Walk the existing site and surroundings**

Go at 8am on a Tuesday. Who's there? Go at noon. Go at 6pm. Go at 10pm. Go on a Saturday afternoon.

**What to observe on the existing site:**
- What's there now? Is it active or vacant?
- What businesses operate? What hours?
- Who walks past? Who stops?
- What's the pedestrian connection to the rest of the neighborhood?

**What to observe in the surrounding neighborhood:**
- What primary uses exist? Residential, commercial, civic?
- What hours are streets active?
- Where are the dead zones (if any)?
- Where do people gather? Why there?

**Now look at the plans:**
- Does the proposed ground floor create activity? Or blank walls?
- What uses are proposed? Do they complement or compete with existing uses?
- What hours will the new uses be active?
- Will this fill a dead zone or create one?
- Where are entrances? Street-facing or hidden?
- How does the scale compare to surroundings?

**Talk to people:**
- What do nearby residents think?
- What do nearby business owners think?
- What do they know about traffic, parking, activity patterns?

**The diagnosis:**
Compare what you observed to what's proposed. Will this development:
- Add primary uses that aren't there now? (Good)
- Add activity at hours currently dead? (Good)
- Create eyes on the street? (Good)
- Create blank walls or dead zones? (Bad)
- Displace existing activity without replacement? (Bad)

The plan may look good on paper. The street will tell you what's missing.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **mixed-use-analysis** - Evaluate the uses you observe
- **eyes-on-the-street** - Assess safety and surveillance
- **emergent-order-recognition** - See what's working in apparent chaos

---

## Constraints

- Requires physical presence (can't be done remotely)
- Multiple visits needed for complete picture
- Your presence may affect what you observe
- Talking to people adds depth but takes time
